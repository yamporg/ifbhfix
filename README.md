# IFBHFix

[Industrial Foregoing](https://github.com/InnovativeOnlineIndustries/Industrial-Foregoing) Black Hole Unit and Tank fix.

IFBHFix is a small mod that fixes the NBT of Black Hole Units and Tanks when managed by Black Hole Controller.
Specifically, slots should not be locked to the last item/fluid type.
